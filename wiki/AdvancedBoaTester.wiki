In this document is described how to create custom test case types and API available.

= Custom test cases =

== Introduction ==

Assume that we have a series of test cases which follows the same common pattern. 

For instance:
 * Run shell script (binary program). This script (program) does very important reports which are placed in directory output as report1.txt report2.txt ... etc
 * Test is passed if all output reports are exactly as expected. The number and content of this files should be exactly the same as reports kept in test case resource directory.

== Prepare test properties files ==

test.property file should contain some property to make it different then the other test cases. Cannot contain keys: testcase (Python Test Case object) nor command (command test case)

Assume something line:

test.properties
