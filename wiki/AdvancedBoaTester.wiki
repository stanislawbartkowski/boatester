In this document is described how to create custom test case types and API available.

= Custom test cases =

== Introduction ==

Assume that we have a series of test cases which follows the same common pattern. 

For instance:
 * Run shell script (binary program). This script (program) does very important reports which are placed in directory output as report1.txt report2.txt ... etc
 * Test is passed if all output reports are exactly as expected. The number and content of this files should be exactly the same as reports kept in test case resource directory.

== Prepare test properties files ==

test.property file should contain some property to make it different then the other test cases. Cannot contain keys: testcase (Python Test Case object) nor command (command test case)

test.properties

{{{
[defaults]
descr=Test custom test case
runcommand=prog.sh
}}}

runcommand property contains command to run.

== Prepare custom test case factory ==

Custom test case factory should be registered. This factory:

 # Should recognize that test case given should be run by custom handler
 # If yes then return TestCase object running this test.

{{{
class MyFactory:

    def constructTestCase(self, param, tepar):
        runcommand = tepar.getPar('runcommand')
        if runcommand == None : return None
        teca = ReportTestCase(param, tepar)
        return [teca]
}}}

Factory class should have 'constructTestCase' method. It this test case (test.property file is passed as tepar parameter) has runcommand property than factory returns 'ReportTestCase' object.
Otherwise return None value.

== Prepare custom TestCase object ==

{{{
class ReportTestCase(unittest.TestCase):

    def __init__(self, param, teparam):
        unittest.TestCase.__init__(self, 'runTest')
        self.param = param
        self.teparam = teparam

    def setUp(self):
        prepareRunDir(self.param, self.teparam)

    def runTest(self):
        runcommand = self.teparam.getPar('runcommand')
        TestCaseHelper.copyFile(self.param, self.teparam, runcommand)
        res = runBin(self.param, "./" + runcommand, runcommand)
        self.assertEqual(0,res)
        res = compareFiles(self.param, self.teparam, "out", ".lst", "out")
        self.assertTrue(res)
}}}

It should extends unittest.TestCase object.

{{{
    def setUp(self):
        prepareRunDir(self.param, self.teparam)
}}}

Copies resources to the test running directory (in this case do nothing but can be added for future extension)

{{{
        runcommand = self.teparam.getPar('runcommand')
        TestCaseHelper.copyFile(self.param, self.teparam, runcommand)
}}}
Copies command from test case directory to test running directory.

{{{
        res = runBin(self.param, "./" + runcommand, runcommand)
        self.assertEqual(0,res)
}}}
Runs command and make sure that command exits with code 0

{{{
        res = compareFiles(self.param, self.teparam, "out", ".lst", "out")
        self.assertTrue(res)
}}}
Compares all files in out in the test case directory with the out directory in test running directory. Test fails if any difference has been found.
