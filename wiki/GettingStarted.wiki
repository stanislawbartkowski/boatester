Getting started with Boa test framework

= Introduction =

Boa is very simple test framework written in Python. Here is described how to download and run framework using samples provided.

= Prerequisites =

Host machine should have Python installed. Almost every linux distribution has Python as a part of standard configuration.

Framework was tested with Python 2.4. Was not tested with Python 3.x (future).

== Instalation ==

Checkout: http://code.google.com/p/boatester/source/checkout

Following directory structure should be created.

{{{
 boatester-read-only/BoaHarness
 boatester-read-only/BoaHarness/src
 boatester-read-only/BoaHarness/src/testharness
 boatester-read-only/BoaHarness/src/testharness/TestCaseHelper.py
 boatester-read-only/BoaHarness/src/testharness/TestCaseHelper.pyc
 boatester-read-only/BoaHarness/src/testharness/__init__.py
 boatester-read-only/BoaHarness/src/testharness/TestBoa.py
 boatester-read-only/BoaHarness/src/testharness/__init__.pyc
 boatester-read-only/BoaHarness/src/testharness/TestBoa.pyc

 boatester-read-only/TestBoaHarness
 boatester-read-only/TestBoaHarness/src
  ...

}}}

Two packages are extracted. BoaHarness contains Boa test framework. TestBoaHarness contains some tests and samples. To run user tests only BoaHarness package is necessary.

To run samples:

On Linux (assuming that packages were checkedout into current directory)

{{{
export PYTHONPATH=boatester-read-only/BoaHarnes
python boatester-read-only/TestBoaHarness/src/testboaharness.py boatester-read-only/TestBoaHarness/src/TestResource /tmp/rundir all x
}}}

Output (if successful )

{{{
dirres  run.sh
